The Level Set method: Part I
============================

The topic in the spotlight of this section is the Level Set Method. In a nutshell, this general philosophy advocates to represent a domain implicitly  to track its evolution in time.

This section is the first of a two-part discussion: basic facts are presented about implicit representations and operations based on the latter in :numref:`sec.imprep` and :numref:`sec.opimpgeom`; the development of fictitious domain methods for the resolution of boundary-value problems is then detailed in :numref:`sec.ficimpref`. The next :numref:`sec.LSM2` deals with more advanced features, and notably the treatment of evolving domain problems with the Level Set Method. 

Before getting into the core of the matter, let us highlight a few useful references. The Level Set Method was introduced in the seminal article :cite:`osher1988fronts`; the comprehensive books :cite:`sethian1999level` and :cite:`osher2006level` are very valuable complements to the succinct presentation of this tutorial. The reader might also find interest in the `slides <https://membres-ljk.imag.fr/Charles.Dapogny/cours/CoursLS2.pdf>`_ of a graduate course given by the author at Universit√© Grenoble-Alpes.

Implicit representation
------------------------

.. #################@
.. #################@

Let $D$ be a bounded domain in $\R^d$, where $d=2$ or $3$, containing the domain of interest $\Omega \subset D$. The Level Set Method consists in looking to $\Omega$ as the negative subset of a \"Level Set function\" $\phi: D \to \R$, that is:

.. math::
  :label: eq.LS
  
  \left\{\begin{array}{cl}
  \phi(\x) < 0 & \text{if } \x \in \Omega,\\
  \phi(\x) = 0 & \text{if } \x \in \partial\Omega,\\
  \phi(\x) > 0 & \text{otherwise.}\end{array}\right.

This change of viewpoints is illustrated on :numref:`fig.illusLS`.

Handling geometry with Level Set functions
-------------------------------------------

.. #################@
.. #################@

One might fear that switching from a conventional to a Level Set representation of a domain entails a loss of information about its geometry. This is fortunately not the case, and we present below a few geometric operations that can be conveniently carried out from Level Set functions.

.. _sec.normalLS:

The normal vector
""""""""""""""""""

.. #################@

Let $\Omega \subset \R^d$ be a smooth bounded domain, and let $\phi : \R^d \to \R$ be an associated smooth Level Set function (i.e. :math:numref:`eq.LS` holds); we also assume that the gradient of $\phi$ does not vanish in a neighborhood of $\partial \Omega$. 

The unit normal vector $\n(\x)$ to $\partial \Omega$ pointing outward $\Omega$ is then expressed in terms of $\phi$ as:

.. math::
  :label: eq.normalLS
  
  \forall \x \in \partial \Omega, \quad \n(\x) = \frac{\nabla \phi(\x)}{\lvert \nabla\phi(\x)\lvert},

see :numref:`fig.normalLS` for an intuition.

.. #################@

.. _fig.normalLS:

.. figure:: ../figures/normls.png
   :scale: 30 %

   The unit normal vector $\n(\x)$ to $\partial \Omega$ at $\x \in \partial \Omega$ is the direction of largest variations of the values of $\phi$ near $\x$ (which is $\nabla\phi(\x)$); it is also orthogonal to the isosurfaces of $\phi$.

.. #################@

Note that the above right-hand side is actually well-defined in the whole computational domain $D$, at least at those points $\x$ where $\nabla \phi(\x)$ does not vanish, so that :math:numref:`eq.normalLS` actually accounts for an extension of the unit normal vector $\n$ to $D$. 


.. #################@

.. _sec.curvatureLS:

The mean curvature
""""""""""""""""""""

.. #################@

In the same context as in the previous section, the mean curvature of $\partial\Omega$ can be calculated from the (admitted) following formula:

.. math::
  :label: eq.curvLS
   
  \forall \x \in \partial \Omega, \quad \kappa(\x) = \dv \left(\frac{\nabla \phi}{\lvert\nabla \phi \lvert} \right)(\x).

Like the formula :math:numref:`eq.normalLS` for $\n(\x)$, this expression actually accounts for a natural extension of the mean curvature away from the boundary $\partial \Omega$.

.. #################@

Operations on sets
""""""""""""""""""

.. #################@

Let $\Omega$, $\Omega_1$, $\Omega_2$ be bounded domains in $\R^d$, and let $\phi$, $\phi_1, \phi_2: \R^d \to \R$ be associated Level Set functions. Then,

  - One Level Set function $\phi_c$ for the complement $^{c}\overline{\Omega}$ of $\Omega$ is:

    $$\phi_c =- \phi.$$

  - One Level Set function $\phi_u$ for the reunion $\Omega_1 \cup \Omega_2$ is:
    
    $$\phi_u = \min(\phi_1,\phi_2).$$
  
  - One Level Set function $\phi_i$ for the intersection $\Omega_1 \cap \Omega_2$ is:
    
    $$\phi_i = \max(\phi_1,\phi_2).$$
    
An illustration of the second formula is given in :numref:`fig.unionLS`. 

.. #################@

.. _fig.unionLS:

.. figure:: ../figures/reuint.png
   :scale: 50 %

   One Level Set function $\phi_u$ for the reunion of $\Omega_1$, $\Omega_2$ is the minimum of Level Set functions $\phi_1$, $\phi_2$ for $\Omega_1$, $\Omega_2$.

Calculation of normal vectors and mean curvatures with Level Set functions in $\texttt{FreeFem}$
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. #################@
.. #################@

In this section, we discuss how the formulas introduced in :numref:`sec.normalLS` and :numref:`sec.curvatureLS` allow to calculate the normal vector and the mean curvature of the boundary of a domain $\Omega$ when the latter is only supplied via a Level Set function.
The code associated to this section is contained in :download:`here <./codes/LSM/LScurv.edp>`

Let $\Omega \subset \R^2$ be a smooth bounded domain, contained in a larger computational domain $D$. Let $\calT$ be a mesh of $D$, and let $\phi : \R^2 \to \R$ be a Level Set function for $\Omega$, discretized as a $\P_1$ Finite Element function on $\calT$.

Let us first consider the practical calculation of the normal vector $\n: \partial \Omega \to \R^2$. The formula :math:numref:`eq.normalLS` can be used readily to this end, as in the following listing. 

.. ############
.. code-block::

   /* Calculation of the components (nx,ny) of the normal vector field n = \frac{\nabla\phi}{\lvert\nabla\phi\lvert} as P0 functions */
   norm0 = sqrt( dx(phi)^2 + dy(phi)^2 + EPS );
   nx0 = dx(phi) / norm0;
   ny0 = dy(phi) / norm0;
   
.. ############

Since $\phi$ is a $\P_1$ Finite Element function, the normal vector is naturally calculated as a (discontinuous) $\P_0$ function, and it is often desirable to handle a $\P_1$ vector field. To achieve this, we rely on a useful general trick to reconstruct a $\P_1$ Finite Element function $u$ from a $\P_0$ function $u_0$. We solve the following variational problem:

$$\text{Search for } u \in H^1(D) \text{ s.t. } \forall v \in H^1(D), \quad \alpha^2 \int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla v \:\d \x + \int_\Omega uv \:\d \x = \int_\Omega u_0 v \:\d \x,$$

by choosing the space of $\P_1$ Finite Elements for the discretization of $H^1(D)$. 
Here, the first integral in the above left-hand side is the bilinear form associated to the Laplace operator, weighted by the \"small\" parameter $\alpha$ (often chosen of the order of the mesh size). It allows to additionally smooth the input field $u_0$ over a length-scale $\alpha$ by virtue of the regularizing properties of this operator, as a means to eliminate undesirable numerical artifacts. This procedure is implemented in the following listing.

.. ############
.. code-block::

   /* Reconstruction of a P1 vector field for the normal vector;
      Add a small smoothing with the Laplacian term \alpha^2 \Delta u */
   problem normalx(nx,v) = int2d(Th)( alpha^2*(dx(nx)*dx(v)+dy(nx)*dy(v)) + nx*v )
                           - int2d(Th)( nx0*v);

   problem normaly(ny,v) = int2d(Th)( alpha^2*(dx(ny)*dx(v)+dy(ny)*dy(v)) + ny*v )
                           - int2d(Th)( ny0*v);
                         
   normalx;
   normaly;

   norm1 = sqrt( nx^2 + ny^2 + EPS );
   nx = nx / norm1;
   ny = ny / norm1;

.. ############

Let us now turn to the mean curvature $\kappa$. Judging from :math:numref:`eq.curvLS`, it is tempting to calculate the extended normal vector $\n = \frac{\nabla \phi}{\lvert \nabla \phi \lvert}$ as a $\P_0$ function on $\calT$, to reconstruct a $\P_1$ function on $\calT$ by a similar trick as in the previous listing, and then to take derivatives in the result. 
Unfortunately, the successive differentiation and $\P_1$ reconstructions of this strategy are likely to cause numerical instabilities. 

In order to alleviate the need for reconstructing $\P_1$ Finite Element functions, we rely on the following application of the :ref:`Green's formula <th.Green>`:

$$\forall v \in H^1(D), \quad \int_D \kappa v \:\d \x = \int_{\partial D} (\n\cdot \n_D) v \:\d s - \int_D \n \cdot \nabla v\:\d \x,$$

where $\n = \frac{\nabla \phi}{\lvert \nabla \phi\lvert}$ is the (extended) normal vector to $\partial \Omega$ and $\n_D$ is the unit normal vector to $\partial D$.
Now, in order to calculate $\kappa$, we directly solve the following variational problem:

$$\text{Search for } u \in H^1(D) \text{ s.t. } \forall v \in H^1(D),\quad \int_D \alpha^2 \nabla u \cdot \nabla v \:\d\x + \int_D uv \:\d \x = -\int_D \n \cdot \nabla v\:\d \x + \int_{\partial D} (\n\cdot \n_D) v \:\d s.$$

Application: fictitious domain methods
---------------------------------------

.. #################@
.. #################@

Sometimes in realistic applications, it may be very complicated to obtain a mesh of the considered domain $\Omega$. It is often easier to introduce a larger, \"simple\" computational domain $D$ (e.g. a box), for which it is possible to construct a mesh ${\mathcal T}$. The domain $\Omega$ is not meshed, but efficient methods (such as those broached in the next :numref:`sec.distLS`) allow to generate an associated level set function $\phi : D \to \R$. An illustration of this situation is provided in :numref:`fig.ersatz`.

In such a setting where it is difficult to directly apply the methods of :numref:`sec.lap` for the resolution of boundary value problems on $\Omega$, a fictitious domain method ca be used.  
Essentially, an approximate problem is introduced, parametrized by a \"small\" parameter $\varepsilon \ll 1$, which is posed on the larger domain $D$. It gives rise to a solution $u_\varepsilon : D \to \R$ whose restriction to $\Omega$ is expected to be close to that of the original model: $u_\varepsilon \lvert_\Omega \approx u$.

Understandably enough, the definition of this approximate problem depends on the nature of the original one, and to illustrate this practice, we consider two model situations. 

Let $\Omega$ be the domain depicted on :numref:`fig.ersatz`, (left), a mesh of which is supplied :download:`here <./codes/LSM/ersatz.mesh>`.
We consider the following boundary-value problems:

.. #################@

.. math:: 
   :label: eq.2pbsers
   
   \left\{
   \begin{array}{cl}
   - \Delta u_1 = 0 & \text{in } \Omega, \\
   u_1 = u_D & \text{on } \Gamma_D, \\
   \frac{\partial u_1}{\partial n} = g & \text{on } \Gamma_N, \\
   \frac{\partial u_1}{\partial n} = 0 & \text{on } \Gamma,
   \end{array}
   \right.
   \:\:\text{ and }\:\: \left\{
   \begin{array}{cl}
   - \Delta u_2 = 0 & \text{in } \Omega, \\
   u_2 = u_D & \text{on } \Gamma_D, \\
   \frac{\partial u_2}{\partial n} = g & \text{on } \Gamma_N, \\
   u_2= 0 & \text{on } \Gamma.
   \end{array}
   \right.

.. #################@

Both problems differ only by the type of boundary conditions imposed on the region $\Gamma$ of $\partial \Omega$.
The code associated to their resolution is available :download:`here <./codes/LSM/laplace_ersatz_tem.edp>`, see :numref:`fig.ersneu` (left) and :numref:`fig.ersdir` (left) for the results.

We now consider the situation where no mesh of $\Omega$ is available. Instead, a mesh $\calT$ of a larger computational box $D$ is provided (which can be downloaded :download:`here <./codes/LSM/box_ers.mesh>`), together with a Level Set function $\phi : D \to \R$ for $\Omega$ (click :download:`here <./codes/LSM/box_ers.sol>`), see :numref:`fig.ersatz` (middle,right).

The next two exercises analyze how to approximately solve both problems :math:numref:`eq.2pbsers` in this context.

.. admonition:: Exercise (Computation of $u_1$ by the ersatz material method)
  :class: admonition-exo

  Let $u_{1,\e}$ be the unique solution in $H^1(D)$ to the following boundary-value problem:
  
  .. math::
    :label: eq.neufic
  
      \left\{\begin{array}{cl}
        -\dv(\gamma_\varepsilon(\x) \nabla u _{1,\varepsilon} ) = 0 &\text{in } D, \\
        u _{1,\varepsilon} = u_D & \text{on } \Gamma_D, \\
        \frac{\partial u _{1,\varepsilon}}{\partial n} = g & \text{on } \Gamma_N, \\
        \frac{\partial u _{1,\varepsilon}}{\partial n} = 0 & \text{on } \partial D \setminus (\overline{\Gamma_D} \cup \overline{\Gamma_N}).
        \end{array}
      \right.
      
  Here, the conductivity $\gamma_\varepsilon(x)$ equals $1$ if the point $x$ is \"well-inside\" $\Omega$ and a very low value $\varepsilon$ if it is \"well-outside\" $\Omega$. In a thin band around $\partial \Omega$, it interpolates between these two values. One possible definition of $\gamma_\e$ exhibiting this behavior is:
  
  $$\gamma_\varepsilon(\x) = \max\left(\varepsilon, \frac{1}{2}\left(1+\tanh\left(-\frac{\phi(\x)}{\varepsilon} \right)\right) \right), \quad \x \in D.$$
   
  Solve :math:numref:`eq.neufic` with $\texttt{FreeFem}$ and compare its solution $u_{1,\e}$ to that $u_1$ of :math:numref:`eq.2pbsers` (left).

  *(Remark: An argument similar to the proof of the exercise in* :numref:`sec.dirtgv` *allows to prove that $u_{1,\e} \to u_1$ in $H^1(\Omega)$.)*

   Let $u_{2,\e}$ be the unique $H^1(D)$ solution to the following boundary-value problem:

     :label: eq.dirfic

     \left\{ \begin{array}{cl}
     -\dv((1+c_\varepsilon(\x)) \nabla u _{2,\varepsilon} ) + c_\varepsilon(\x) u _{2,\varepsilon} = 0 &\text{in } D, \\
     u _{2,\varepsilon} = u_D & \text{on } \Gamma_D, \\
     \frac{\partial u _{2,\varepsilon}}{\partial n} = g & \text{on } \Gamma_N, \\
     u _{2,\varepsilon} = 0 & \text{on } \partial D \setminus (\overline{\Gamma_D} \cup \overline{\Gamma_N}).
     \end{array}
     \right.

   Here, $c_\varepsilon(\x)$ equals $0$ if the point $\x$ is \"well-inside\" $\Omega$ and takes a very large value $\frac{1}{\e}$ if it is \"well-outside\" $\Omega$. In a thin band around $\partial \Omega$, it interpolates between these two values. An example of a function showing this behavior is:
  
   $$c_\varepsilon(\x) = \frac{1}{2\varepsilon}\left(1+\tanh\left(\frac{\phi(\x)}{\varepsilon}\right)\right), \quad \x \in D.$$
   
   Solve :math:numref:`eq.dirfic` with $\texttt{FreeFem}$ and compare its solution $u_{2,\e}$ to that $u_2$ of :math:numref:`eq.2pbsers` (right).
