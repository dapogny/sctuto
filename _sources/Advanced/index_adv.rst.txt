More advanced issues in scientific computing
============================================

This chapter is the natural continuation of :numref:`chap.start`, where we have introduced the basic mathematical ingredients needed in the treatment of variational problems, as well as the convenient $\texttt{FreeFem}$ environment for their implementation. 
The present section builds on the contents of :numref:`chap.start` and jumps to slightly more specific tools, that are transverse to many application fields while being perhaps a little less widely discussed in the literature.
